\subsection{Integration/Feature Testing}
In this section we present the Integration tests between the components of the back-end system.\\
As Integration we test the Features provided by each API.\\
Please note that for privileged endpoints we have omitted the cases in which the request is not authenticated. \\
The reason for this is that the authentication middleware is a separated component and is tested separately.\\
Also the expression "with valid data" refers to the validation rules associated with each request.
