# Travlendar+
Travlendar+ is a calendar based application whose goal is to help registered users organize their day by scheduling their appointment and providing the best solutions in terms of mobility.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized in this way:
- **Installation Instructions:** everything you need to know to setup the application.
- **Documentation:** all the project related documentation.
- **iOS:** front-end source code.
- **Laravel:** back-end source code.
- **Images:** all the images created to build up the UI and create the logo.


# Documentation
Each stage of the application development was fully documented. In the Documentation folder you can find:
- **RASD**: Requirements Analysis Specification Document.
- **DD**: Design Document.
- **ITD**: Implementation and Testing Document.
- **ATD**: Acceptance Test Document (of another related project developed by a different team).

# Architecture
Travlendar+ is designed with a multitier architecture.
A multitier architecture is a clientâ€“server architecture in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated. The most common multi-tier architecture is the three-tier, composed by the following three layers: **Presentation tier**, **Domain logic tier**, **Data storage tier**. We added a fourth tier, the **Web tier**, in order to handle requests from web users.
